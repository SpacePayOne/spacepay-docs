  provide real-time cryptocurrency quotes.
  
  **2. Token Reception**: We receive
  the cryptocurrency tokens from your customers on the specified blockchain
  network.
  
  **3. Validation**: Our system validates that the correct amount of
  tokens was received and confirms the transaction on the blockchain.

  cryptocurrency to your preferred settlement currency.
