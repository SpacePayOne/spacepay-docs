## Step 4: Accept Your First Payment

Now you're ready to integrate SpacePay into your application:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Option 1: Hosted Checkout (Easiest)">
  Use our hosted checkout page for the quickest integration:
  
  ```javascript
  // Redirect customers to SpacePay checkout
  const checkoutUrl = `https://checkout.spacepay.co.uk/pay?api_key=${API_KEY}&amount=100&currency=USD`;
  window.location.href = checkoutUrl;
  ```
  
  <Tip>
  This method requires minimal code and handles all payment UI automatically.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2: API Integration">
  For more control, integrate directly with our API:
  
  ```javascript
  // Create a payment intent
  const response = await fetch('https://api.spacepay.co.uk/v1/payment-intents', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: 10000, // $100.00 in cents
      currency: 'USD',
      description: 'Test payment'
    })
  });
  
  const paymentIntent = await response.json();
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 3: Drop-in UI">
  Embed our payment widget directly in your page:
  
  ```html
  <div id="spacepay-checkout"></div>
  <script src="https://js.spacepay.co.uk/v1/checkout.js"></script>
  <script>
    SpacePayCheckout.mount('#spacepay-checkout', {
      apiKey: 'your-api-key',
      amount: 10000,
      currency: 'USD'
