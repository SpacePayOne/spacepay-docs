<Accordion title="Option 1: API Integration">
  For more control, integrate directly with our API:
  
  ```javascript
  // Create a payment
  const response = await fetch('https://api.spacepay.co.uk/v1/external/secretkey-auth/payments', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'X-SpacePay-Secret-Key': 'sk_test_your_secret_key',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Idempotency-Key': 'unique-key-for-request' // Optional but recommended
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      orderId: 'order_123',
      amount: 100, // $1.00 in cents (minimum: 100, maximum: 100000000)
      currency: 'USD',
      redirectUrl: 'https://merchant.example.com/checkout/success', // Optional
      customMetadata: '{"cartId":"abc123","promo":"SUMMER24"}' // Optional
