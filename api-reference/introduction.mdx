# SpacePay API Reference

Welcome to the SpacePay API documentation. This reference provides comprehensive information about our REST API endpoints, authentication methods, and integration examples.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Your API Keys">
  Generate your API keys in the admin dashboard under Settings → Developers → API Keys.
  
  <Note>
    **API Keys**: Available in both testnet and mainnet environments. Test keys start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Environment">
  Select the appropriate base URL for your integration: - **Testnet**:
  `https://api-testnet.spacepay.co.uk` (for development) - **Mainnet**:
  `https://api.spacepay.co.uk` (for production)
</Step>

<Step title="Start Integrating">
  Use our SDK or integrate directly with our REST API endpoints.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your secret key with the `X-SpacePay-Secret-Key` header:

```javascript
const headers = {
  "X-SpacePay-Secret-Key": "sk_test_your_secret_key",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Idempotency-Key": "unique-key-for-request", // Optional but recommended
};
```

<Warning>
  Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories. Use
  environment variables and server-side implementations only.
</Warning>

## Webhook Events

SpacePay sends webhooks for the following events:

- `payment.created`: Payment has been created and is ready for customer payment
- `payment.updated`: Payment status has been updated (confirmed, failed, expired, etc.)

<Note>
  **Webhook Secret**: Each webhook endpoint gets its own unique secret key for
  signature verification. Set up webhooks in your admin dashboard under Settings
  → Developers → Webhooks.

try {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);

  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    console.error("API Error:", error.message);
